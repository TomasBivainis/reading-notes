# Notes for the book in the title

- **Point** - 1$ per share or 1 index unit.

## Terms

- **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** - the belief that the markets are efficient and the set prices include all public information, hence there are no "under valued" or "over valued" assets.
- **Greater Fools Theorem** - a speculator can make money on an overvalued asset if it can later be resold to another sepculator at a higher price.

## Places to find financial information

- [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/) - reports
- [Standart and Poor's (S&P)](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/) - reports
- [Value Line](https://www.valueline.com/) - ratings and reports on stock (more specific that the last 2)
- Brokerage and investment banks - reports, but have to trade with them (the cost is the commission).
- Private investment letters that are distributed to paid subscribers, they cost a lot, some have been prepared for years and are highly respected.

## The Securities Markets

- For a market to be competetive, it usually must be sufficiently large so that any buyer (seller) can purchase (sell) whatever quantity he or she wishes at the given price.
- **Floating supply** - total number of shares issued by a company.
- **Turnover rate** - the percentage of shares traded relative to the total number of outstanding shares over a specific period (usually anually).
- **Market depth** - the ability of the market to sustain relatively large buy and sell orders without significantly impacting the price of the security. Small turnover rates imply lesser market depth.
- **Organized securities markets** - organized major exchanges. There is a record for each transaction, and an investor can observe the last price at which the security was traded. He or she may call a broker or follow the market online and find out at what price a particular stock opened (its first price for the day) and obtain the current quotation.
- **Over-the-counter (OTC) market** - any securities transaction that does not take place on an exchange is said to be an OTC trade. The OTC market consists of numerous brokers, traders, and dealers who “make a market” in bonds and shares and are ready to buy or sell to each other and the investing public. Business is conducted via telephone or computer, and there may be no formal signal to other investors when a transaction has taken place.
  - **Bid price** - the amount that is offered for the purchase of a security.
  - **Ask price** - the amount that is required by the seller.
  - **Spread** - A “spread” between the bid and ask prices that serves to compensate those who make a market in the issue will typically exist. Depending upon the depth of the market, spreads may vary from 1 or 2 percent to as large as 5 percent. (Ask price - bid price)

The primary (new issue) market is the first sale or new issue market. All Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) are new issues. When a firm (or government) sells its securities to the public, it is a primary transaction. After a bond or share is in the hands of the public, any trading in the security is said to be in the secondary market. Both exchange and OTC transactions can be secondary trades.

- **Market order** - order to broker to buy or sell security at the best available price.
- **Limit order** - specified a maximum (minimum) price that the customer is willing to pay (receive) to buy (sell) the stock.
- **Stop order** - provides a price above (below) the current market price of the stock that, if reached by the market, the customer desires to trigger a buy (sell) market order.

## SEC

- **10-K** - a detailed annual filing.
- **10-Q** - a somewhat less detailed quarterly filing.
- **8-K** - a filing required in the case of a special event or change in the firm's circumstances such as the resignation of a member of the company's board of directors.
- **Proxy Statement** - indicates when and where the firm's annual meeting is to take place.
